# Game Of Life
This is Java implementation of John Conway's Game Of Life. The Game of Life is set in an infinite two-dimensional grid inhabited by `cells`. Every cell interacts with up to eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. 

From an initial seed grid the game `evolves` one iteration at a time. An iteration applies rules to the grid to determine its next state.

# How to use
This implementation is meant for a console-based environment and thus can be run in terminal(mac) or Command prompt(Windows).
To run the application, please ensure you have the latest versions of Java Runtime Environment and Java Compiler are installed.

From the Terminal, navigate to the directory containing your .java files, say ~User/Desktop/Game-Of-Life/src, by typing the cd command below.
>machine:~ user$ cd Desktop/Game-Of-Life/src<br>
>machine:src user$

The file to compile is GameOfLife.java which is in the current working directory, type the javac command below to compile it.
>machine:src user$ javac HelloWorld.java<br>
>machine:src user$

If everything went well, you should see no error messages. Try deleting project and downloading again to try to resolve the issue.

Finally, in order to run the application, from the current working driectory, type in the following:
>machine:src user$ java HelloWorld<br>
>machine:src user$

Once the application is running, you can hit `ENTER` to get next iteration or hit `Q` to exit the application
